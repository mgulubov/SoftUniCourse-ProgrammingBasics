C++Builder - a rapid application development (RAD) environment, originally developed by Borland and as of 2009 owned by Embarcadero Technologies, for writing programs in the C++ programming language targeting Windows and OS X. C++Builder combines the Visual Component Library and IDE written in Delphi with a C++ compiler. Most components developed in Delphi can be used in C++Builder with no or little modification, although the reverse is not true.
C++Builder includes tools that allow drag-and-drop visual development, making programming easier by incorporating a WYSIWYG graphical user interface builder.

MyEclipsE 2014 - a commercially available Java EE and Ajax IDE created and maintained by the company Genuitec, a founding member of the Eclipse Foundation.
MyEcliPse is built upon the Eclipse platform, and integrates both proprietary and open source code into the development environment.
MyEclipse has two primary versions (apart from the "Blue Edition and "MyEclipse Spring Edition referred to below): a professional and a standard edition. The standard edition adds database tools, a visual web designer, persistence tools, Spring tools, Struts and JSF tooling, and a number of other features to the basic Eclipse Java Developer profile. It competes with the Web Tools Project, which is a part of Eclipse itself, but MyEclipse is a separate project entirely and offers a different feature set.

Anjuta - an integrated development environment written for the GNOME project. It has support for the C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and Vala programming languages. It comes standard on base installation DVDs of major Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, openSUSE, Fedora, and Mandriva Linux (amongst others).

Embarcadero Delphi - an integrated development environment (IDE) for console, desktop graphical, web, and mobile applications.
Delphi's compilers use their own Object Pascal dialect of Pascal and generate native code for 32- and 64-bit Windows operating systems, as well as 32-bit Mac OS X, iOS and Android. As of late 2011 support for the Linux operating system was planned by Embarcadero.
Delphi was originally developed by Borland as a rapid application development tool for Windows, and as the successor of Borland Pascal. Delphi and its C++ counterpart, C++Builder, shared many core components, notably the IDE and VCL, but remained separate until the release of RAD Studio 2007. RAD Studio is a shared host for Delphi, C++Builder, and others.
In 2006, Borland’s developer tools section were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary known as CodeGear, which was sold to Embarcadero Technologies in 2008.

KDevelop - a free software integrated development environment (IDE) for the KDE Platform on Unix-like computer operating systems. KDevelop includes no compiler; instead, it uses an external compiler such as GCC or Clang to produce executable binaries.
The current version, 4.7.0, was officially released on 13 September 2014, and will be the last version to use Qt 4 and KDElibs 4, as the next major release will rely on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. It builds on various KDE Platform 4 technologies and supports C, C++, PHP, and Python development, among others.
The last stable release of the previous major version, 3.5.5, which is based on K Desktop Environment 3 technology, supports many programming languages such as Ada, Bash, C, C++, Fortran, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. Released under the GNU General Public License, KDevelop is free software.
